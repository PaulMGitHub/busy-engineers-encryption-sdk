So far we've been working with the SDK's KMS client directly. This has a few
limitations, as we'll see.

# Before we start

We'll assume that you've completed the code changes in [exercise
1](1-kms_encryption.md) first. If you haven't, you can use this git command to
catch up:

    git checkout -f -B exercise-2 origin/exercise-2-start

This will give you a codebase that already has the base64 changes applied.
Note that any uncommitted changes you've made already will be lost.

# Exploring the limitations of direct KMS

Directly using KMS means that your messages will be limited in size to 4096
bytes. Try this out for yourself - copy and paste this block into the message
field, and see how KMS rejects the message:

> The history of war teems with occasions where the interception of
> dispatches and orders written in plain language has resulted in

You may also have noticed that using the KMS client directly requires
a fair amount of boilerplate - in particular, all those byte buffer
conversions. It's also difficult to put any kind of dynamic data in
the encryption context, as you need to find a separate place to store
those context values. We'll resolve all of these by converting things
to use the encryption SDK instead.

# Overview of exercise

In this exercise we'll:

1. Implement encryption using the AWS Encryption SDK
2. Set up a dynamic encryption context

## Step by step

First, let's make sure the encryption SDK is set up as a dependency correctly.
Open up `webapp/pom.xml` and add this block in the `<dependencies>` section:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
            <artifactId>aws-encryption-sdk-java</artifactId>
            <version>1.3.1</version>
        </dependency>

Now, let's add some imports:

    import java.util.Objects;
    import com.amazonaws.encryptionsdk.AwsCrypto;
    import com.amazonaws.encryptionsdk.CryptoResult;
    import com.amazonaws.encryptionsdk.kms.KmsMasterKey;
    import com.amazonaws.encryptionsdk.kms.KmsMasterKeyProvider;

The first step to using the Encryption SDK is setting up a master key (or
master key provider) to decide which keys will be used for the encryption.
Once we set up our master key, we won't need to keep around the `keyId` field,
so go ahead and replace it with:

    private final KmsMasterKey masterKey;

In our constructor, we'll create the master key like so:

    this.masterKey = new KmsMasterKeyProvider(keyId)
        .getMasterKey(keyId);

The actual encryption process is much simpler than with KMS. We'll keep the
context hashmap mostly the same, and the body of encrypt can just be:

    public String encrypt(JsonNode data) throws IOException {
        FormData formValues = MAPPER.treeToValue(data, FormData.class);

        // We can access specific form fields using values in the parsed FormData object.
        LOGGER.info("Got form submission for order " + formValues.orderid);

        byte[] plaintext = MAPPER.writeValueAsBytes(formValues);

        HashMap<String, String> context = new HashMap<>();
        context.put(K_MESSAGE_TYPE, TYPE_ORDER_INQUIRY);

        byte[] ciphertext = new AwsCrypto().encryptData(masterKey, plaintext, context).getResult();

        return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(ciphertext);
    }

For decrypt, we no longer need to construct an encryption context, because the
Encryption SDK records the original context for us. However, this means we now
need to check that the context is consistent with what we expected.
Decrypt therefore ends up looking like:

    public JsonNode decrypt(String ciphertext) throws IOException {
        byte[] ciphertextBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(ciphertext);

        CryptoResult<byte[], ?> result = new AwsCrypto().decryptData(masterKey, ciphertextBytes);

        // Check that we have the correct type
        if (!Objects.equals(result.getEncryptionContext().get(K_MESSAGE_TYPE), TYPE_ORDER_INQUIRY)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Bad message type in decrypted message");
        }

        return MAPPER.readTree(result.getResult());
    }

At this point you should be able to deploy and test the application. Try
entering the very large message from the start of this exercise; it should work
now.

_Note: If you input a message larger than about 90k you'll still run into
message size limits related to our use of SQS as well. If handling very large
messages was needed for your application, you might want to consider putting
the message in S3, and sending a reference to it via SQS._

# Adding additional audit metadata to your encryption context

Now that you're using the encryption SDK, it's a lot easier to put
dynamically-changing data in the encryption context. For example, we can record
the order ID just by doing:

    context.put("order ID", formValues.orderid);

No changes are needed in decrypt (however, it's good practice to check at least
that the key exists now). If you add this, send some messages, and then check
your cloudtrail logs after 10 minutes, you'll see the encryption context values
flowing through.

One caveat to note is that encryption context values can't be empty strings; to
deal with this, you can either use special values to indicate empty/null
fields, or only add the key if the field has a meaningful value (or require
that the field be present).
